      "description": "I have been studying the Golang programming language in my spare time. I was particularly impressed by the simplicity and the strength in the area of parallel processing. I used the language together with the Gin framework to create web servers. It is currently my most used language for backend applications. I hope that a better error handling will be implemented soon."

Elixir has a very interesting error handling, which works either by throwing or by return types, but the missing typing didn't appeal to me very much."

In my studies I had subjects from the basics, over algorithms and data structures, to advanced technologies, like JavaFX. In my first part-time job, I then learned about data management with MySQL and Hibernate. Furthermore, I know my way around Spring and Lombok."

In my spare time, I started to work with GraphQL in the Node.js area and I am still very enthusiastic about this technology. It allows to design an API as efficient as possible and at the same time to decide in the frontend which data is really needed for the current query."
